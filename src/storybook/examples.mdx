# Examples

This page contains examples of the Concrete Vue plugin options in action

## Global Input Handler

For the following example we have registered a global input handler like so:

```javascript dark
app.use(Concrete, {
  inputHandler: (id, value) => alert(`Input with id '${id}' was changed to ${value}`),
});
```

Now this handler will be fired everytime one of Concrete's input components is blurred, or the enter key is pressed.

*The blur handler has been disabled for this example due to conflicting behaviour with the alert box.*

  <Story of={ExamplesStories.GlobalInputHandler} />
</Canvas>

## Local Input Handler

In this example the same global handler registration has taken place, but we are overriding the default behaviour by
passing in a custom handler.

<Canvas transformSnippet="open">
  <Story of={ExamplesStories.LocalInputHandler} />
</Canvas>
