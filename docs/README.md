# Concrete Design System

Concrete is a Vue UI toolkit designed and built by the team at [www.crh.io](https://www.crh.io).
It is intended for technical interfaces, with components specifically tailored for engineering
and design software.

With regards to visual presentation, the system tends to be opinionated rather than flexible (although default styles can be overridden when desired). The goal is to encourage UI consistency in a variety of different technical applications.
