# Introduction

When designing compontents for Concrete try and adhere to the following rules:

- No rounded corners

- Form rows are as follows:
  - Small: 32px + 1px border = (34px)
  - Medium: 40px + 1px border = (42px)
  - Small: 48px + 1px border = (50px)

- Take inspiration on functionality from [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.dev/vue) over [ConcreteV1](https://concrete.crh.io/)

- Design components in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/zcsyUddEGUEVB9B8zxxHZx/Style-Guide-V2) first 

- Concrete uses [Tailwind3](https://tailwindcss.com/), familiarise yourself with the JIT engine to avoid problems with class not being loaded
